# Abstract

Lip reading, ie. the tracking of lips to inform speech understanding, is a rich informational medium that can supplement traditional auditory speech recognition. One particular area of impact is inferring punctuation from spoken speech. Though this task has been tackled from an auditory perspective, we aim to determine whether lip-reading can also yield successful outcomes. To ensure feasibility, we simplified the task to identifying word endings from purely visual inputs. We examined four algorithms to delimit words: decision trees, support vector classifiers, multi-layer perceptron networks, and recurrent neural networks. We also examined inputting one frame compared to multiple consecutive frames at once. We found that the recurrent neural network performed best, which had an f1 score of 0.172 and accuracy of 0.680.
